ECO-CONNECT User Community Web Application

This project was developed in Flutter using Dart, html, CMake, and C++. This application focuses on instilling community
connections and engagement. As we evolve to become more digitally connected, we have become less physically connected to those
closest to us. That is why we bring you Eco-Connect. You can participate in local events, yard sales, community gardens, and 
much more in your own neighborhood. Not only will you be helping your neighbors with businesses and eco-friendly opportunities,
you can create such opportunities yourself!

Upon running the application, you can sign up using Google or SMS. If using SMS you will be prompted for a 6 digit code.
To sign-in to an existing account, you can use Google, SMS, or email/password. All users except for those using Google
login will need to register their phone number to their account. These providers are supplied through Firebase Authentication.
If using phone, a Recaptcha token may appear and will need to be answered.

Once logged in, a user may view listings from other users on the main page.
By clicking the map button, a user can see their location.
When selecting a post, a user can comment on the post and/or report the post for suspicious activity to be monitored by our
team.
A user can browse through listings by categories or click "Add to Service" on the top left to make a post. A dropdown list
allows the poster to categorize the post.

By the bottom navigation bar a user can visit their Direct Messages, Profile page, or Search page. 

On the DM's page, a user can review all messages received by other others and visit the profile of a specific user in a chat
Upon reviewing a profile, a user may rate the other user through a 5 star system. When a user receives a new message, a banner
notification will pop up on their screen.

For the Profile page a user can edit their profile information.

The Search page allows one to search for posts by key words.

Note messaging rates may apply for SMS login and you will be prompted for notifications and location approval.
